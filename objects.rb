#### Question 1
# Define a class called `Pet`, and a class `Dog` that inherits from `Pet`.


#### Question 2
# Copy your class definitions from question 1 here.
# Then add an initializer to the `Pet` class that accepts a "name" argument
# and stores the value as an instance variable.


#### Question 3
# Copy your class definitions from question 2 here.
# Then add an instance method called `bark` to the `Dog` class that returns the
# string "bark bark".


#### Question 4
# Write code that would create a new instance of the `Dog` class with the
# name "Lassie", and call the `bark` method on it.


#### Question 5
# Write code that would create a new instance of the `Pet` class with the
# name "Reginald". Assuming the `Pet` class had a setter for "name", write
# code that would change Reginald's name to "Snookums".
