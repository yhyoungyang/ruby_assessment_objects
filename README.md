# Ruby Objects Assessment

## Medieval Objects
We are going to model a game that is set in Medieval Times. Along the way we are going to create:

#### Person
A `Person` class that is the "root" of the class hierarchy
  - Attributes
    - `first_name`
    - `last_name`
    - `full_name`

#### Player
A `Player` class that is a subclass of the Person class.
  - Attributes
    - `health`, defaults to 20, strength, defaults to 5
    - `alive`, default is true. A player will be dead if there health reaches zero
  - Methods
    - `take_damage(attack_strength)`: subtract the attack_strength from the recievers health.
    - `attack(player)`: call the player's take_damage method passing the attackers strength as an argument.

#### Knight
A `Knight` will be a subclass of the `Player` class.
  - It's default `health` will be 50
  - It's default `strength` will be 7

#### Wizard
A `Wizard` will be a subclass of the `Player` class.
  - It's default health will be 20
  - It's default strength will be 75

## Instructions

- Fork and clone this repo, change into the `ruby_assessment_objects` directory.
- Run `bundle install`
- Create a game program (in `lib/asessment.rb`) that will model a battle/fight between players, knights and wizards. Don't need user input, unless you feel you want to.
- On Github, initiate a Pull Request to turn in your assessment
